# Libft (42 School Project)

At 42, during our time learning C we are extremely limited in terms of allowed external functions through includes.

Therefore the first project for all students is to create our own C library which we will be able to use throughout all our future projects. The project in itself requires us to add about 60 functions to the library (mainly functions that already exist in the standard LibC). We are encouraged to add new functions to the library as we progress. You will therefore find within this library some more trivial functions such as putstr, strlen... and some more complex such as get_next_line or printf.

# How to run:

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/ElioDillenberg/Libft_42.git libft
cd libft
make
</pre>

You can now use the generated libft.a file and the libft.h file within your projects to have access to the functions of my Library.

Enjoy!

NB: The official project subject can be found as PDF in the subject folder.
