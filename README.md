libft_42

At 42, during our time learning C we are extremely limited in terms of allowed external functions through includes.

Therefore the first project for all students is to create our own C library which we will be able to use throughout all our future projects. The project in itself requires us to add about 60 functions to the library (mainly functions that already exist in the standard LibC). We are encouraged to add new functions to the library as we progress. You will therefore find within this library some more trivial functions such as putstr, strlen... and some more complex such as get_next_line or printf.

Usage:
1. make (to compile the libft.a file)

2. Compile your project with the libft.a file and include libft.h to have access to all functions within the library
